- Description
- Suggested fix

[SHOULD] Consider async/await in api.py:89 - improves I/O performance

## Code Context
```
{code_context}
```

## Reviewer's Feedback (Disputed)
{review_item}

## Coder's Objection
{coder_objection}

## Your Task
Evaluate both perspectives objectively and make a decision:

1. **ENFORCE** - The reviewer is correct. The coder must implement the feedback.
2. **DISMISS** - The coder's objection is valid. The review item can be ignored.
3. **ESCALATE** - The situation is ambiguous and requires human judgment.

## Guidelines
- Focus on technical correctness, not preferences
- Consider: Does the review identify a real issue? Is the coder's objection factually accurate?
- ENFORCE if: The review catches a genuine bug, security issue, or violation of requirements
- DISMISS if: The review is based on a misunderstanding, or the suggestion would break functionality
- ESCALATE if: Both sides have valid points, or the decision requires domain knowledge you lack

## Response Format
Start your response with one of: ENFORCE, DISMISS, or ESCALATE

Then provide a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) justifying your decision.

Example:
ENFORCE
The reviewer correctly identified a SQL injection vulnerability. The coder's objection that "the input is trusted" is incorrect because user input should never be trusted without validation."""

    return f"""You received the following review feedback on your code:

{review_items}

Instructions:
- Default stance: the reviewer is probably right. Accept and implement all valid feedback.
- Do NOT disagree unless there is a clear, objective technical reason.

Valid reasons to disagree:
- Factual error in the review (reviewer misread the code)
- Suggestion would break existing functionality
- Suggestion conflicts with explicit project requirements
- Reviewer misunderstood the context or intent

Invalid reasons to disagree:
- Personal preference or style
- "I think my way is better"
- Minor differences that don't affect correctness
- Ego or defensiveness

If you disagree with a MUST or HIGH item:
- You MUST provide specific technical justification
- Cite concrete evidence (code references, requirements, tests)
- Be objective, not defensive

Remember: You are a collaborative agent, not a defender of your code.
